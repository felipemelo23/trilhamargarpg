# Trilhamarga RPG - FoundryVTT System

This project is a custom system module for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) implementing the mechanics of the **Trilhamarga RPG**.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Roll System
The system uses a custom 1d12-based resolution:
- **Base Roll**: `1d12` vs. **Difficulty**.
- **Critical Success**: Natural 12.
- **Critical Failure**: Natural 1.
- **Positive Modifier**: `2d12kh` (Keep Higher).
- **Negative Modifier**: `2d12kl` (Keep Lower).

Rolls are triggered via the `.rollable` class on character sheets or through the `actor.roll()` method.

### 2. Meta-currency (Destiny & Doom)
- **Destiny (Group)**: Visible to all; GM can grant/spend; Players can spend.
- **Doom (GM)**: Visible to all; Only GM can grant/spend.
- **Tracker**: A persistent UI element (`DestinyTracker`) is anchored to the bottom-left of the screen, just above the players panel.

### 3. Data Architecture (`template.json`)
- **Actors**: 
  - `pc`: Player characters with derived stats (Life, Load Capacity) and narrative descriptors.
  - `npc`: Streamlined non-player characters.
- **Items**:
  - `skill`: Proficiency level (-1 to +6).
  - `gear`: Equipment with slot and stacking logic.
  - `wound`: Tracks injury severity affecting Life and penalties.
  - `divine_domain`, `spell`, `recipe`: Categorized magic/alchemy entries.

```

## Maintenance & Development

### Derived Data
Most character stats (Life, Load Capacity, Wound Penalties) are calculated in `TrilhamargaActor.prepareDerivedData()`. Avoid storing these in the database; always calculate them based on related items (e.g., Life is based on the `Physique` skill and `wound` items).

### Adding New Tabs
1. Update `TrilhamargaActorSheet.defaultOptions` to include the tab name.
2. Add the `<nav>` entry and `<section class="tab">` in `pc-sheet.html` or `npc-sheet.html`.
3. Ensure items are filtered into the correct data category in `TrilhamargaActorSheet._preparePcItems()`.

### Localization
Always use `{{localize 'KEY'}}` in templates and `game.i18n.localize('KEY')` in JavaScript. New keys must be added to both `lang/en.json` and `lang/pt-BR.json`.

## Coding Standards
- **ES Modules**: Use `.mjs` for all JavaScript files.
- **Language**: Code logic and variables must be in **English**. String literals and UI text must use **localization keys**.
- **Foundry API**: Target compatibility with the latest stable FoundryVTT version.
